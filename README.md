# Teaching material for Food Data Analysis
This repo contains a Quarto-based site containing teaching material for the Food Data Analysis course at UCPH.

## Notes for updating 

### File structure
The chapters are structured using a folder for each week and every folder contains the following:

- A `week_x.qmd` document containing the introduction to the chapter.
- A `.qmd` file for each section contained in the section.
- Data and images used in each chapter.

### Custom callouts
The document uses a custom LUA-filter for creating callouts used for tasks and exercises. Both are styled in the `style.scss` sheet.
