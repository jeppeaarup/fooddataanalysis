## The normal distribution - in short {#sec-intro-to-normal}

If $X$ is normaly distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the probability density function for a given draw from that distribution $x$ is given by 

$$
P(x) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}e^{{{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 }}}
$$

Further, the cumulative density function can be found by integration of this formula
$$
P(X \leq x) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }} \int_{-\inf}^x e^{{{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 }}} \, dx
$$

The short notation for this distribution is

$$
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)
$$

### Estimation of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ {#sec-estimation-of-parameters}

More often than not, the distribution is unknown. That is the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are unknown and must then be estimated from data.

$\mu$ characterizes the center of the distribution, and is naturally estimated by the mean-value of the data-points ($\bar{X}$). $\sigma$ reflects the spread around the mean, and is in a similar fashion estimated by the standard deviation ($\hat{\sigma}$ or $s$). 

$$
\hat{\mu} = \bar{X} = \sum_{i = 1}^n X_i / n = (X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \ldots + X_n) / n
$$


$$
\hat{\sigma}^2 = s^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2 / (n-1) = ((X_1 - \bar{X})^2 + (X_2 - \bar{X})^2 + (X_3 - \bar{X})^2 + \ldots + (X_n - \bar{X})^2 ) / (n-1)
$$

### Effect of caffeine on activity

Caffeine is a central neurvous system stimulant, which can have several positive- and negative effects. In this study, the level of activity is up for examination, and for this purpose a model-system; the runing activity of mice in a wheel reflected as the number of rounds pr minutes recorded over 7 minutes. Here a total of 249 mice from two species; one breed to be high in running performance, and one control, where given either Water, Gatorade or Red Bull followed by measuring their voluentary wheel run activiy. Of interest is the average actvity within each mouse type and for each caffeine type and how large the spread is.

The data is listed in a table with 249 rows (here, the first five samples are shown):

```{r}
head(X)
```

To get the experimental design, the table() function nicely summarize the numbers within each group:

```{r}
table(X$gender:X$MouseType, X$Caffeine)
```

Before doing anything else, the data is plotted to visualize the response as function of the design (@fig-caffeine-vs-rpm).

```{r}
#| label: fig-caffeine-vs-rpm
#| fig-cap: Box n' jitter plot of the RPM7 variable as a function of treatment. 
ggplot(X, aes(Caffeine, RPM7, color = Caffeine)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .75) + # Alpha controls opacity
  facet_wrap(~MouseType) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # Remove the legend
```


As an example, the mean and standard deviation is calculated for females of the unselected breed given water. The example is given using both base R and Tidyverse.

::: {.panel-tabset}
#### Using base R

First, the information is extracted from the dataset:

```{r}
extracted_x <- X[
  X$MouseType == "Control runner" & X$gender == "Female" & X$Caffeine == "Water", # Rows
  "RPM7"] # Column
```


And then the extracted information can be fed into the `mean()` and `sd()` functions.

```{r}
mean(extracted_x)
sd(extracted_x)
```

#### Using Tidyverse

In Tidyverse the `filter`-function is used to filter by the `MouseType`, `gender`, and `Caffeine` levels of interest. Afterwards, the mean and standard deviation are computed using `summarise`. 

```{r}
X |> 
  filter(
    MouseType == "Control runner",
    gender == "Female",
    Caffeine == "Water"
  ) |> 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(RPM7),
    sd = sd(RPM7)
  )
```

::: 
<!-- End tabset -->

Both methods output a mean and standard deviation of 

$$
\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{n} \approx 8.6
$$

$$
\hat{\sigma} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})}{n - 1} \approx 2.1
$$

for the particular group of interest.

A more efficient way of doing this would be to calculate the mean and standard deviation of each combination and display them in a table. The example below is given using both base R and Tidyverse.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Using base R
In base R `aggregate()` can be used to calculate a function over a group. 

```{r}
# Compute number of observations, mean and sd across groups
n <- aggregate(X$RPM7, by = list(X$MouseType, X$gender, X$Caffeine), length)
m <- aggregate(X$RPM7, by = list(X$MouseType, X$gender, X$Caffeine), mean)
s <- aggregate(X$RPM7, by = list(X$MouseType, X$gender, X$Caffeine), sd)

# Combine and set column names
stat_table <- cbind(n, m$x, s$x)
colnames(stat_table) <- c("MouseType","Gender","Caffeine","N","mean","sd")

# Print as nice markdown table
kable(stat_table, digits = 2)
```

#### Using Tidyverse

In Tidyverse, the `group_by()`-function is used to group the observations by everything but the column `RPM7` (so that will be type, gender and caffeine). Then, the number of observations, mean and standard devations are calculated across groups, giving the information for each group in one go.

```{r}
X |> 
  group_by(across(-RPM7)) |> 
  summarise(
    N = n(),
    mean = mean(RPM7),
    sd = sd(RPM7)
  ) |> 
  kable(digits = 2) # Output pretty table in markdown
```

### Effect of caffeine on activity - probability

Example @exa-effect-of-caffeine estimates the activity distribution of mice based on experimental data. Under the assumption that these metrics, the mean and the standard deviation, perfectly describe the distribution of the data, and further that this distribution is the normal distribution, we wish to calculate the probability of a given female mice, from normal breed, assigned water to perform *higher than 10 RPM7*.

That is: 

\begin{align*}
P(X \geq 10) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\int_{10}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{(z - \mu)^2}{2\sigma}} dz \\
&= 1 - P(X < 10) \\
%X &= X \\
%X &= X
&= 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\int_{-\infty}^{10} e^{-\frac{(z - \mu)^2}{2\sigma}} dz \\
%N(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dz
\end{align*}

where $X$ is assummed normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.  
That is: $X \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu,\sigma^2)$. \\ 

A small illustration below (@fig-normal-dist-rpm7) shows the area of interest.

```{r}
#| label: fig-normal-dist-rpm7
#| fig-cap: Normal density function fitted to the selected mouse population. The red area is the density for RPM7 >= 10. 

# Create normal distributed data using estimated mean and sd
df <- data.frame(x = seq(2, 16, 0.01)) |> 
  mutate(y = dnorm(x, mean(extracted_x), sd(extracted_x))) 

# Plot normal curve 
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_area(data = subset(df, x >= 10), fill = "red") +
  labs(
    x = "RPM7",
    y = "Probability"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

The size of the red area is simply calculated via the `pnorm()` function.

```{r}
1 - pnorm(10, mean(extracted_x), sd(extracted_x))
```

$$
P(X \geq 10) \approx 0.26
$$

The probability of a single female mice, from normal breed, administered with water to perform higher than $10 RPM7$ is hence $0.26$.

### Confidence interval for $\mu$

The confidence interval for the center of a normal distribution ($\mu$) is calculated as follows: 

$$
CI_{\mu,1-\alpha}:  \hat{\mu} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2,df} \cdot \hat{\sigma} / \sqrt(n)
$$
$$
\bar{X} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2,df} \cdot s / \sqrt(n) 
$$

where $t_{1-\alpha/2,df}$ is a fractile, a number, which determines the coverage. Here, $\alpha$ is the left ot part. I.e. if a $90 \%$ confidence interval is wanted, the left out part is $\alpha = 0.10$. $n$ is the number of samples on which the mean ($\bar{X}$) is estimated, and $df$ is the degrees of freedom, which refers to how well the standard deviation is estimated. 

For instance, if one needs a $95 \%$ confidence interval ($\alpha = 0.05$) based on a sample of $20$ observations $t_{1-\alpha/2,df} = t_{0.975,20-1} = 2.093$.

It is further noticed that the interval is symmetric around the mean, and that the more samples ($n$) the lower the spread as the standard deviation is divided by $\sqrt{n}$.

### Effect of caffeine on activity - confidence intervals

In example @exa-effect-of-caffeine concerning the relation between caffeine and voluntary activity of mice, the running activity of mice in a wheel is recorded. In this example we wish to estimate the mean activity of the two groups with either water- or Red bull as caffeine source in control runner female mice, and give a confidence interval for these means. 

First, the data is subset to only include the two groups of interest. 

```{r}
x_subset <- X |> 
  filter(
    MouseType == "Control runner",
    gender == "Female",
    Caffeine %in% c("Red Bull", "Water")
  )
```

After subsetting the data to only include these two groups a plot of the raw data looks like the following, and consists of $n = n_1 + n_2 = 11+ 9 = 20$ samples (@fig-mouse-subset).

```{r}
#| label: fig-mouse-subset
#| fig-cap: Box n' jitter plot of the mouse data subset. 

ggplot(x_subset, aes(Caffeine, RPM7, color = Caffeine)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # Remove legend
```


The mean and standard deviation for the two groups can be calculated using `summarise()` via Tidyverse or `aggregate()` in base R (see @exa-effect-of-caffeine for an example on `aggregate`).

```{r}
x_subset |> 
  group_by(Caffeine) |> 
  summarise(
    N = n(),
    mean = mean(RPM7),
    sd = sd(RPM7)
  ) |> 
  kable(digits = 2) # For pretty tables in markdown
```

The confidence interval is calculated as follows: 

\begin{align}
CI_{\mu}: & \hat{\mu} \pm t_{0.975,n-1} \cdot \hat{\sigma} / \sqrt(n) \\
& \bar{X} \pm t_{0.975,n-1} \cdot s / \sqrt(n) 
\end{align}

With a total of $df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 10$ degress of freedom the t-fractileat level $95 \%$ is $t_{0.975,10} = 2.23$ why the confidence interval for the water treated group is:

$$
CI_{\mu_{water}}:  [8.6 - 2.23 \cdot 2.1 / \sqrt{11}; 8.6 + 2.23 \cdot 2.1/ \sqrt{11}]  =  [7.3; 10.0] 
$$

```{r}
n <- 11 # Number of obs in water group
t_frac <- qt(1 - 0.05/2, n - 1) # T-value
s <- sd(x_subset[x_subset$Caffeine == "Water", "RPM7"])
m <- mean(x_subset[x_subset$Caffeine == "Water", "RPM7"])

ci_lower <- m - t_frac * s / sqrt(n)
ci_upper <- m + t_frac * s / sqrt(n)

cat("95% confidence interval for water group:\n", c(ci_lower, ci_upper))
```

And similar for the Red bull treated group.

\begin{equation}
CI_{\mu_{Red Bull}}: [8.5; 11.8]
\end{equation}

\vspace{10mm}

In R this can be assesed via the `t.test()` function.

```{r}
t.test(x_subset[x_subset$Caffeine == "Water", "RPM7"])
```

### Normal Distribution

Serum cholestorol level is a biomarker of health in relation to a range of life-style related diseases. A population of adults have mean values of $178 mg/100mL$ and $207 mg/100mL$, standard deviations of $31 mg/100mL$ and $37 mg/100mL$ in males and females respectively.

3. What percentage are above $140 mg/100 mL$
:::

A level above $240 mg/100 mL$ is considered high risk, whereas the range between $200$ and $239 mg/100 mL$ is considered borderline high risk.

7. What is the propability that a random person from that population have a serum cholesterol level higher than $240 mg/100mL$.
:::

 Use that the mean and variance of a sum of two populations is the sum of the means and variance respectively. That is; Let $X$ and $Y$ be two indepedent random variables with mean $\mu_X$ and $\mu_y$ and variance $\sigma^2_X$ and $\sigma^2_Y$ respectively. And let: 

$$
Z = c_1X+ c_2Y

### WHO height and weight - standard normal distribution

Height and weight are important measures of growth during childhood. However, the largest factor impacting these measures are naturally the age of the child. In order to be able to compare children with slightly different ages such data are transformed using so-called growth curves. These are provided by the WHO and are constructed to represent the world wide distribution at specific ages for boys and girl. In this exercise you are supposed to take height and weight measures from African children living under different circumstances, transform them using WHO numbers for the world wide distribution, and further look for explanatory variables causing differences in growth.

::: {.callout-task}
1. Start by importing the *GrowthData.xlsx* dataset into R. Check that all the info from the excel file was imported correctly using the commands `dim()` and `head()`. You can ’chop’ the dataframe in R to isolate the variables of importance (length, sex, age etc.).
2. Using the following graphs (@fig-length-for-age), find the mean and standard deviation for boys and girls at age 15 months.
:::

3. Based on the dataset imported, calculate mean and standard deviation for the girls and the boys, how does it relate to the data from WHO?
:::

You can use the command `X <- X[complete.cases(X),]` to remove the empty rows in the dataframe `X`, or google how to compute descriptive statistics in the case of missing values. 

::: {.callout-task}
4. What is the Z-value? How can you use it to relate the dataset to the WHO data?
5. Calculate the Z-scores for all the boys and girls.
:::

This can be done by creating a new vector inserting the length-vector from the previous dataframe to the equation for Z-score.

::: {.callout-task}
6. What does it mean that a child is above or below 0 in Z-score? How many children has a Z-score below -2 and -3?
7. How many children are longer/taller than the world average? 
8.  Investigate whether some of the other variables (source of water *primary_watersource* or treatment of water *water_treatment_type*) impact the length at 15 months. Use `ggplot()` to do the plotting, and then use `ggplot(...) + facet_wrap(~SEX)` to split the plot in two corresponding to the variable *SEX*. Are the trends similar for the two sexes?
